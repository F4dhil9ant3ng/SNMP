# SNMP
VB.Net SNMP Trap Send/Receive Test Application

I wrote this application a few years ago as a way of learning the basics of SNMP V2.  There were very few decent SNMP/Networking code samples for VB.Net then so hopefully anyone browsing this page will find this useful.  It is basically a trap receiver with a simple trap sender.  I initially used ireasoning to generate the test traps to parse.  I have started working on a suite of Windows monitoring tools so this may be updated at some time in the future.
